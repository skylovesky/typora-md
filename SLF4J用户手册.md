SLF4J user manual

The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) serves as a simple    facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks, such as    java.util.logging, logback and log4j. SLF4J allows the end-user to    plug in the desired logging framework at *deployment* time.    Note that SLF4J-enabling your library/application implies the    addition of only a single mandatory dependency, namely    *slf4j-api-2.0.0-alpha2-SNAPSHOT.jar*.

since 1.6.0 If no binding is found on the    class path, then SLF4J will default to a no-operation    implementation.    

since 1.7.0 Printing methods in the    [`Logger`](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/Logger.html)    interface now offer variants accepting [varargs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/varargs.html)    instead of `Object[]`. This change implies that SLF4J    requires JDK 1.5 or later.  Under the hood the Java compiler    transforms the varargs part in methods into    `Object[]`. Thus, the Logger interface generated by the    compiler is indistinguishable in 1.7.x from its 1.6.x    counterpart. It follows that SLF4J version 1.7.x is totally 100%    no-ifs-or-buts compatible with SLF4J version 1.6.x.    

since 1.7.5 Significant improvement    in logger retrieval times. Given the extent of the improvement,    users are highly encouraged to migrate to SLF4J 1.7.5 or later.    

since 1.7.9 By setting the    `slf4j.detectLoggerNameMismatch` system property to    true, SLF4J can automatically [spot incorrectly named     loggers](http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#loggerNameMismatch).    

since 2.0.0 SLF4J API version 2.0.0    requires Java 8 and introduces a backward-compatible fluent logging    API. By backward-compatible, we mean that existing logging    frameworks do not have to be changed in order for the user to    benefit from the [fluent logging API](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#fluent).    

### Hello World

As customary in programming tradition, here is an example    illustrating the simplest way to output "Hello world" using SLF4J.    It begins by getting a logger with the name "HelloWorld". This    logger is in turn used to log the message "Hello World".    

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloWorld.class);
    logger.info("Hello World");
  }
}
```

To run this example, you first need to [download the slf4j distribution](http://www.slf4j.org/download.html), and     then to unpack it. Once that is done, add the file     *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* to your class path.

Compiling and running *HelloWorld* will result in the     following output being printed on the console.

```
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
```

This warning is printed because no slf4j binding could be     found on your class path.

The warning will disappear as soon as you add a [binding](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping) to your class path. Assuming you add     *slf4j-simple-1.7.28.jar* so that your class     path contains:

- slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar
- slf4j-simple-1.7.28.jar

Compiling and running *HelloWorld* will now result in     the following output on the console.

```
0 [main] INFO HelloWorld - Hello World
```

### Typical usage     pattern

The sample code below illustrates the typical usage pattern     for SLF4J. Note the use of {}-placeholders on line 15. See the     question ["What is the      fastest way of logging?"](http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance) in the FAQ for more details.     



```
 1: import org.slf4j.Logger;
 2: import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
 3: 
 4: public class Wombat {
 5:  
 6:   final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Wombat.class);
 7:   Integer t;
 8:   Integer oldT;
 9:
10:   public void setTemperature(Integer temperature) {
11:    
12:     oldT = t;        
13:     t = temperature;
14:
15:     logger.debug("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", t, oldT);
16:
17:     if(temperature.intValue() > 50) {
18:       logger.info("Temperature has risen above 50 degrees.");
19:     }
20:   }
21: } 
```

### Fluent Logging API

since 2.0.0 SLF4J API version      2.0.0 requires Java 8 and introduces a backward-compatible      fluent logging API. By backward-compatible, we mean that      existing logging frameworks do not have to be changed in order      for the user to benefit from the [fluent       logging API](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#fluent).      

The idea is to build a logging event piece by piece with a [LoggingEventBuilder](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/spi/LoggingEventBuilder.html)      and to log once the event is fully built. The      `atTrace()`, `atDebug()`,      `atInfo()`, `atWarn()` and      `atError()` methods, all new in the      `org.slf4j.Logger` interface, return an instance of      [`LoggingEventBuilder`](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/spi/LoggingEventBuilder.html).      For disabled log levels, the returned      `LoggingEventBuilder` instance does nothing, thus      preserving the nano-second level performance of the traditional      logging interface.

Here are few usage examples:

The statement

```
logger.atInfo().log("Hello world");
```

is equivalent to:

```
logger.info("Hello world.");
```

The following log statements are equivalent in their output      (for the default implementation):

```
        int newT = 15;
        int oldT = 16;

        // using traditional API
        logger.debug("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", newT, oldT);

        // using fluent API, add arguments one by one and then log message
        logger.atDebug().addArgument(newT).addArgument(oldT).log("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.");

        // using fluent API, log message with arguments
        logger.atDebug().log("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", newT, oldT);

        // using fluent API, add one argument and then log message providing one more argument
        logger.atDebug().addArgument(newT).log("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", oldT);

        // using fluent API, add one argument with a Supplier and then log message with one more argument.
        // Assume the method t16() returns 16.
        logger.atDebug().addArgument(() -> t16()).log(msg, "Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", oldT);
      
```

The fluent logging API allows the specification of many      different types of data to a `org.slf4j.Logger`      without a combinatorial explosion in the number of methods in      the `Logger` interface.

It is now possible to pass multiple [Markers](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/Marker.html), pass arguments      with a [Supplier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html)      or pass multiple key-value pairs. Key-value pairs are      particularly useful in conjuction with log data analysers which      can interpret them automatically.

The following log statements are equivalent:

```
        int newT = 15;
        int oldT = 16;

        // using classical API
        logger.debug("oldT={} newT={} Temperature changed.", newT, oldT);

        // using fluent API
        logger.atDebug().addKeyValue("oldT", oldT).addKeyValue("newT", newT).log("Temperature changed.");          
      
```

The key-value pair variant of the API stores the key-value      pairs as separates objects. The default implementation as      shipping in the `org.slf4j.Logger` class      *prefixes* key-value pairs to the message.  Logging      backends are free to customize the output as they see fit.

### Binding with a logging      framework at deployment time

As mentioned previously, SLF4J supports various logging      frameworks. The SLF4J distribution ships with several jar files      referred to as "SLF4J bindings", with each binding corresponding      to a supported framework.  

- *slf4j-log4j12-1.7.28.jar*        

  Binding for [log4j         version 1.2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html), a widely used logging framework. You also        need to place *log4j.jar* on your class path.

- *slf4j-jdk14-1.7.28.jar* 

  Binding for java.util.logging, also referred to as JDK 1.4        logging 

- *slf4j-nop-1.7.28.jar*

  Binding for [NOP](http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/helpers/NOPLogger.html),        silently discarding all logging.

- *slf4j-simple-1.7.28.jar*

  Binding for [Simple         ](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html) implementation, which outputs all events to        System.err. Only messages of level INFO and higher are        printed. This binding may be useful in the context of small        applications.

- *slf4j-jcl-1.7.28.jar*

  Binding for [Jakarta Commons         Logging](http://commons.apache.org/logging/). This binding will delegate all SLF4J logging to        JCL.        

- *logback-classic-1.2.3.jar (requires logback-core-1.2.3.jar)*

  Native implementation There are also        SLF4J bindings external to the SLF4J project, e.g. [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) which implements        SLF4J natively.  Logback's        [         `ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger`](http://logback.qos.ch/apidocs/ch/qos/logback/classic/Logger.html) class is a        direct implementation of SLF4J's [         `org.slf4j.Logger`](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/Logger.html) interface. Thus, using SLF4J        in conjunction with logback involves strictly zero memory and        computational overhead.         

â€‹      

To switch logging frameworks, just replace slf4j bindings on      your class path. For example, to switch from java.util.logging      to log4j, just replace slf4j-jdk14-1.7.28.jar with      slf4j-log4j12-1.7.28.jar.      

SLF4J does not rely on any special class loader machinery. In      fact, each SLF4J binding is hardwired *at compile time*      to use one and only one specific logging framework.  For      example, the slf4j-log4j12-1.7.28.jar binding is      bound at compile time to use log4j.  In your code, in addition      to *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar*, you simply drop      **one and only one** binding of your choice onto the      appropriate class path location. Do not place more than one      binding on your class path. Here is a graphical illustration of      the general idea.      

â€‹       ![](F:\note\java\images\concrete-bindings.png)

The SLF4J interfaces and their various adapters are extremely      simple. Most developers familiar with the Java language should      be able to read and fully understand the code in less than one      hour.  No knowledge of class loaders is necessary as SLF4J does      not make use nor does it directly access any class loaders. As a      consequence, SLF4J suffers from none of the class loader      problems or memory leaks observed with Jakarta Commons Logging      (JCL).      

Given the simplicity of the SLF4J interfaces and its      deployment model, developers of new logging frameworks should      find it very easy to write SLF4J bindings.      

### Libraries

Authors of widely-distributed components and libraries may      code against the SLF4J interface in order to avoid imposing an      logging framework on their end-user.  Thus, the end-user may      choose the desired logging framework at deployment time by      inserting the corresponding slf4j binding on the classpath,      which may be changed later by replacing an existing binding with      another on the class path and restarting the application.  This      approach has proven to be simple and very robust.      

**As of SLF4J version 1.6.0**, if no binding is found on      the class path, then slf4j-api will default to a no-operation      implementation discarding all log requests. Thus, instead of      throwing a `NoClassDefFoundError` because the      `org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder` class is missing,      SLF4J version 1.6.0 and later will emit a single warning message      about the absence of a binding and proceed to discard all log      requests without further protest. For example, let Wombat be      some biology-related framework depending on SLF4J for      logging. In order to avoid imposing a logging framework on the      end-user, Wombat's distribution includes *slf4j-api.jar*      but no binding. Even in the absence of any SLF4J binding on the      class path, Wombat's distribution will still work      out-of-the-box, and without requiring the end-user to download a      binding from SLF4J's web-site. Only when the end-user decides to      enable logging will she need to install the SLF4J binding      corresponding to the logging framework chosen by her.      

Basic rule **Embedded components      such as libraries or frameworks should not declare a dependency      on any SLF4J binding but only depend on slf4j-api**. When a      library declares a transitive dependency on a specific binding,      that binding is imposed on the end-user negating the purpose of      SLF4J. Note that declaring a non-transitive dependency on a      binding, for example for testing, does not affect the      end-user.

SLF4J usage in embedded components is also discussed in the      FAQ in relation with [logging configuration](http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#configure_logging), [dependency reduction](http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#optional_dependency) and      [testing](http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#optional_dependency).

### Declaring project      dependencies for logging

Given Maven's transitive dependency rules, for "regular"      projects (not libraries or frameworks) declaring logging      dependencies can be accomplished with a single dependency      declaration.      

logback-classic If you wish      to use logback-classic as the underlying logging framework, all      you need to do is to declare "ch.qos.logback:logback-classic" as      a dependency in your *pom.xml* file as shown below. In      addition to *logback-classic-1.2.3.jar*,      this will pull *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* as well      as *logback-core-1.2.3.jar* into your      project. Note that explicitly declaring a dependency on      *logback-core-1.2.3* or      *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* is not wrong and may      be necessary to impose the correct version of said artifacts by      virtue of Maven's "nearest definition" dependency mediation      rule.      

```xml
<dependency> 
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

â€‹       

log4j If you wish to use      log4j as the underlying logging framework, all you need to do is      to declare "org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12" as a dependency in your      *pom.xml* file as shown below. In addition to      *slf4j-log4j12-1.7.28.jar*, this will pull      *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* as well as      *log4j-1.2.17.jar* into your project.  Note      that explicitly declaring a dependency on      *log4j-1.2.17.jar* or      *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* is not wrong and may      be necessary to impose the correct version of said artifacts by      virtue of Maven's "nearest definition" dependency mediation      rule.

```xml
<dependency> 
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.28</version>
</dependency>
```

â€‹       

java.util.logging If you      wish to use java.util.logging as the underlying logging      framework, all you need to do is to declare      "org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14" as a dependency in your *pom.xml*      file as shown below. In addition to      *slf4j-jdk14-1.7.28.jar*, this will pull      *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* into your project.      Note that explicitly declaring a dependency on      *slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar* is not wrong and may      be necessary to impose the correct version of said artifact by      virtue of Maven's "nearest definition" dependency mediation      rule.

```xml
<dependency> 
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.28</version>
</dependency>
```

### Binary      compatibility

An SLF4J binding designates an artifact such as      *slf4j-jdk14.jar* or *slf4j-log4j12.jar* used to      *bind* slf4j to an underlying logging framework, say,      java.util.logging and respectively log4j.      

From the client's perspective all versions      of slf4j-api are compatible.  Client code compiled with      slf4j-api-N.jar will run perfectly fine with slf4j-api-M.jar for      any N and M. You only need to ensure that the version of your      binding matches that of the slf4j-api.jar. You do not have to      worry about the version of slf4j-api.jar used by a given      dependency in your project. 

Mixing different versions of *slf4j-api.jar* and SLF4J      binding can cause problems. For example, if you are using      slf4j-api-1.7.28.jar, then you should also use      slf4j-simple-1.7.28.jar, using      slf4j-simple-1.5.5.jar will not work.

However, from the client's perspective all versions of      slf4j-api are compatible. Client code compiled with      *slf4j-api-N.jar* will run perfectly fine with      *slf4j-api-M.jar* for any N and M. You only need to      ensure that the version of your binding matches that of the      slf4j-api.jar. You do not have to worry about the version of      slf4j-api.jar used by a given dependency in your project. You      can always use any version of *slf4j-api.jar*, and as      long as the version of *slf4j-api.jar* and its binding      match, you should be fine.      

At initialization time, if SLF4J suspects that there may be      an slf4j-api vs. binding version mismatch problem, it will emit      a warning about the suspected mismatch.      

### Consolidate logging via      SLF4J

Often times, a given project will depend on various      components which rely on logging APIs other than SLF4J. It is      common to find projects depending on a combination of JCL,      java.util.logging, log4j and SLF4J. It then becomes desirable to      consolidate logging through a single channel. SLF4J caters for      this common use-case by providing bridging modules for JCL,      java.util.logging and log4j. For more details, please refer to      the page on [**Bridging legacy       APIs**](http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html).      

### Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) support

"Mapped Diagnostic Context" is essentially a map maintained      by the logging framework where the application code provides      key-value pairs which can then be inserted by the logging      framework in log messages. MDC data can also be highly helpful      in filtering messages or triggering certain actions.

SLF4J supports MDC, or mapped diagnostic context. If the      underlying logging framework offers MDC functionality, then      SLF4J will delegate to the underlying framework's MDC. Note that      at this time, only log4j and logback offer MDC functionality. If      the underlying framework does not offer MDC, for example      java.util.logging, then SLF4J will still store MDC data but the      information therein will need to be retrieved by custom user      code.

Thus, as a SLF4J user, you can take advantage of MDC      information in the presence of log4j or logback, but without      forcing these logging frameworks upon your users as      dependencies.      

For more information on MDC please see the [chapter on MDC](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html)      in the logback manual.      

### Executive summary

| Advantage                                        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Select your logging framework at deployment time | The desired logging framework can be plugged in at          deployment time by inserting the appropriate jar file          (binding) on your class path. |
| Fail-fast operation                              | Due to the way that classes are loaded by the JVM, the          framework binding will be verified automatically very early          on.  If SLF4J cannot find a binding on the class path it          will emit a single warning message and default to          no-operation implementation. |
| Bindings for popular logging frameworks          | SLF4J supports popular logging frameworks, namely log4j,          java.util.logging, Simple logging and NOP. The [logback](http://logback.qos.ch) project supports          SLF4J natively. |
| Bridging legacy logging APIs                     | The implementation of JCL over SLF4J, i.e            *jcl-over-slf4j.jar*, will allow your project to            migrate to SLF4J piecemeal, without breaking compatibility            with existing software using JCL. Similarly,            log4j-over-slf4j.jar and jul-to-slf4j modules will allow            you to redirect log4j and respectively java.util.logging            calls to SLF4J. See the page on [Bridging legacy APIs](http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html) for more            details. |
| Migrate your source code                         | The [slf4j-migrator](http://www.slf4j.org/migrator.html) utility          can help you migrate your source to use SLF4J. |
| Support for parameterized log messages           | All SLF4J bindings support parameterized log messages          with significantly [improved performance](http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance)          results. |
